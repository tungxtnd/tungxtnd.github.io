                <p class="p1">In this tutorial, we are creating a photo shoot effect with 
                    our just-released PhotoShoot jQuery plug-in. With it, you
                    can convert a regular div on the page into a photo
                    shooting stage simulating a camera-like feel.

                    Potential clients want to see who they'll be working with.
                    They want to hire people, not stock photography. We 
                    produced a custom photo shoot to bring the people of
                    Paterson Buchanan front and center and to underscore
                    the firm's open and welcoming style. Vivid images
                    illustrate Paterson Buchanan's wide range of clients, as
                    well as their commitment to the picturesque region the
                    firm serves.
